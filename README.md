# lmos-nodejs-lang300

A HTTP redirector which navigates users to language-specified URLs based on their language preferences

## Motivation

My name is [Kyle Chine](https://www.kylechine.name). I am a Chinese blogger who also has an English blog. I am hosting my blogs at:

1. <https://zh-hans.blog.kylechine.name> for the Simplified Chinese version
2. <https://zh-hant.blog.kylechine.name> for the Traditional Chinese version
3. <https://en.blog.kylechine.name> for the English version

Although these are well-structured URLs, I believe everybody should agree that this is not user-friendly at all.

What I need is an easy-to-remember portal URL <https://blog.kylechine.name> for all my blogs, via which my readers could be redirected to a specified language version according to their language preferences.

This is the reason behind `lmos-nodejs-lang300` project. 300 is come from HTTP 3xx status codes.

## How It Works

Firstly, this application will check a browser cookie named `lang`. If its value is a supported [language tag](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5646), then redirect the user to the language-specified URL.

Secondly, the HTTP [Accept-Language](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.html#page-104) request header will be checked with a supported language list. The user will be redirected to a matched language-specified URL.

Lastly, if no language could be matched, the user will be redirected to the default langugae URL.
